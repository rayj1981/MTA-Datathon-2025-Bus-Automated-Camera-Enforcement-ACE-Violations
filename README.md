# üöç Bus Lanes, ACE, and Congestion Pricing: Impacts on CUNY Communities

## üìå Overview
This project investigates how **Automated Camera Enforcement (ACE)** and upcoming **Congestion Pricing** affect bus performance in New York City, with a focus on **CUNY campuses**.

We answer:
1. Which CUNY campuses are served by ACE-enforced bus routes?
2. How much have bus speeds changed since ACE rollout?
3. Where, when, and who is violating bus lanes?
4. How might congestion pricing amplify these effects within the Central Business District (CBD)?

## üóÇÔ∏è Data Sources
- **MTA Bus Speeds (2020‚Äì2024)** ‚Äî NYC Open Data  
- **Automated Camera Enforcement Violations (2019‚Äì2025)** ‚Äî NYC Open Data  
- **Bus Lanes Shapefile** ‚Äî NYC DOT Open Data  
- **CUNY Campus Locations** ‚Äî NYC Open Data  
- **Congestion Pricing Zone (CBD boundary)** ‚Äî NYC DOT

## üîç Methodology
1. **Data Integration**  
   - Collected bus speed data from 2020‚Äì2024 and linked it with Automated Camera Enforcement (ACE) violations.  
   - Mapped CUNY campus locations and overlaid them with ACE-enforced bus routes.  
   - Incorporated the Central Business District (CBD) boundary to assess congestion pricing impacts.  

2. **Spatial Analysis**  
   - Used geospatial joins to identify violations occurring inside vs. outside the CBD.  
   - Cross-referenced ACE bus corridors with proximity to CUNY campuses.  
   - Produced violation heatmaps to identify hotspots of bus lane blockages.  

3. **Temporal Trends**  
   - Compared average bus speeds before ACE (2020‚Äì2022) vs. after rollout (2023‚Äì2024).  
   - Examined violation patterns by time of day and day of week.  
   - Identified peak congestion and enforcement periods.

## üìä Key Findings
- **Bus Speeds Improved on ACE Routes**  
  - Example: The **M101** saw a **+13% speed increase**, the **M2** +12%, and the **M42** +4%.  
  - Improvements were strongest on corridors with consistent ACE enforcement.  

## Comparative Analysis of Bus Speeds

The following chart compares average bus speeds before and after the implementation of key initiatives like the Automated Camera Enforcement (ACE) program, highlighting trends from 2020-2023 versus 2023-2024.

- **Violations Cluster in Busy Midtown Corridors**  
  - Hotspots align with **major commercial avenues** (e.g., 42nd Street, 14th Street).  
  - Violations peak **midday (12‚Äì2 PM)** and **evening (5‚Äì7 PM)** ‚Äî overlapping with student commuting hours.  

- **CUNY Campuses Are Directly Affected**  
  - Several campuses (e.g., Baruch, BMCC, Hunter) are along ACE-enforced bus lanes.  
  - Students benefit from faster and more reliable buses, especially on cross-town routes.  

- **Congestion Pricing Likely to Amplify ACE Benefits**  
  - By reducing private vehicle trips into the CBD, congestion pricing could further cut delays.  
  - Expected synergy: **fewer violators + lower traffic volumes = faster buses.**

## Geographic Analysis of Bus Speeds

This map visualizes bus routes in New York City's Central Business District (CBD), colored by their average speed. The spatial representation helps identify corridors with persistent congestion and areas where interventions like ACE have had the most significant impact.

## üéì Impact on CUNY Communities
- **Accessibility:** Faster buses reduce commute times for thousands of students who rely on them daily.  
- **Equity:** Many CUNY students come from outer boroughs ‚Äî ACE and congestion pricing make travel more reliable without additional cost.  
- **Safety:** Clearer bus lanes mean fewer pedestrian conflicts and safer streets around campuses.  

---

## üåç Policy Implications
- **Scaling Up ACE:** Expanding ACE to more corridors could replicate speed improvements citywide.  
- **Student Advocacy:** CUNY students stand to gain from both ACE and congestion pricing, making them key stakeholders in transit justice.  
- **Data Transparency:** Continued open data reporting ensures accountability and helps measure impacts post-congestion pricing rollout.

## üìà Next Steps
- Track bus speeds and violations **after congestion pricing begins**
